## 1. Overview

The idea behind this project was to identify a problem faced by a majority of citizens and provide a feasible solution which would help solve this problem, by also taking feedback from the citizens to as whether this idea would be something they would want to invest in.

___

## 2. Our Approach

1. Breadboard implentation

- We started with getting Arduino modules then writing the code according to the functionality we needed.


2. Power Supply 

- Battery : We used 2 Li-ion 18650 batteries in series.
- Charging : For charging we implemented a circuit with auto cut-off at 8.4V since we used 2 batteries in series.

3. Enclosure

- We drew an initial sketch of what our product should look like and also made 3D model of it.

## 3. Project Setup

```
NOTE : You have the option to directly refer to the GRC files that contain the relevant flowgraphs. It is not mandatory to set up the Interface.
```

### 3.1 PCB

[GNU Radio](https://www.gnuradio.org/) is an open-source toolkit for software-defined radio development. It provides signal processing blocks to build versatile radio systems, including sophisticated in wireless communication systems.

Refer to their documentation on [how to set up GNU Radio](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/InstallingGR) on your device along with bladeRF driver installation.

Prefered : **Linux Environment**
```
We attempted driver installation in a Windows environment, but configuring the drivers proved challenging. It's recommended to opt for a Linux OS for a smoother GNU Radio installation.
```

### 3.2 Enclosure

We used [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to interface our project with GRC flow graphs and python files generated by them.

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SasikaA073/CDP-communication-system
    cd CDP-communication-system
    cd ST_Webapp
    ```

2. Install venv

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python3-venv
    ```

3. Create a Python virtual environment named "gnu":

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv gnu
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    source gnu/bin/activate
    ```

5. Install the required Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file:

    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6. Run the following to start the interface

    ```bash
    streamlit run Home.py
    ```
